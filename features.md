The biggest goal of LaraLlama is to empower non developer, normal day to day users, build timesaving workflows using LLMs and their data.


# Features

Below is a list of features to consider as you start using LaraLlama.io 

But there are so many day to day tasks right now that you might discover can be used here. One article talks about this 
[LLM Integration Levels and your Business, it does not have to be all or nothing!](https://medium.com/@alnutile/llm-integration-levels-and-your-business-it-does-not-have-to-be-all-or-nothing-98fd841b3c0b) and how to test out these use cases for your day to day work.


## Collection

Dead simple way to centrlize documents, for example "HR Documents", "Marketing Documents", "Customer Feedback Emails", "Research about xyz".

You can see more about this in the Traing

## Dynamic Updates to Collection

Another big feature is that when you create a Collection you can have it seek out new documents as well as upload your own. Here are some examples:

  * Search the web for news about LLMs as a source of daily data added to your collection
  * Check an Email box for new emails
  * Scrape data from a website or 10 of them!
  * Point it to a website feed to pull in new data every hour
  * Send Webhooks to it from any application with webhooks (GitHub, Stripe and more)

This means you can keep adding to your data from any source without any extra work.


## Talk to any LLM

We can intergrate with any LLM including private self hosted LLMs.

  * ChatGPT
  * Claude
  * Groq
  * Ollama - Open-Source

## Simple click interface to make new Sources and Outputs!

Easily add sources and outputs to your collection. For example, check an email box for emails, then if it is an HR related email check the HR collection and reply to the sender!

## Extendable

LaraLlama is built on top of the most well known framework out there https://laravel.com so you and your team can easily build on to it.

## Filters

You can filter or Group documents and then use that filter in your chats


## Personals and Audience

You can help the LLM format the output in your voice or the Marketing team voice etc. And you can have the output written and focus on the topics the audience you choose can relate to.
For example "Developer Audience" vs "Business Audience"

## ReportBuilding

Create a Collection of Customer Feedback, or Marketing Leads and start building reports on that data to get you started.
Choose the Audience to help fine tune the focus of the report.
